# pulumi-exercise

### Notes from process:
#### inital build using a [pulumi template](https://www.pulumi.com/templates/serverless-application/gcp/)

#### currently getting 400 errors on the db instance and cloud function. 
#### tried testing out just creating the db and cloud function in the console and figured out I needed to enable a lot of APIs and add roles to the cloud function
